## About GreenEarth

<p>
Global warming is proportional to the total amount of carbon dioxide that human activities add to the atmosphere. And this level of carbon dioxide is rising day by day. Deserts are spreading, oceans are warming, and sadly our biodiversity is collapsing. In October 2020, Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever. According to the United Nations, carbon neutrality by 2050 is the worldâ€™s most urgent mission.

<strong> icrewsystems </strong> is taking the initiative to counter the rising levels of carbon dioxide. Our objective through GreenEarth is to nullify the carbon dioxide produced by the servers required to host websites.

Carbon-neutral IT infrastructure is not a luxury but <strong> a necessity! </strong>
