## Welcome to GreenEarth

*"The earth does not belong to man, man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself."* - Native American Chief Seattle

<br>

With the GreenEarth initiative, our mission, as mere strands in the web of life, is to use the web of computing to weave the earth into a greener place for posterity.

Global warming is proportional to the total amount of carbon dioxide that human activities add to the atmosphere. And this level of carbon dioxide is rising day by day. Deserts are spreading, oceans are warming, and sadly our biodiversity is collapsing. In October 2020, Arctic sea ice was the lowest ever. According to the United Nations, carbon neutrality by 2050 is the worldâ€™s most urgent mission.

**icrewsystems is taking the initiative to counter the rising levels of carbon dioxide. Our objective through GreenEarth is to nullify the carbon dioxide produced by the servers required to host websites.**

**Carbon-neutral IT infrastructure is not a luxury but a necessity.**
